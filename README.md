# Python Practice and Mini Project
This repository contains a collection of Python-based **practice problems**, **terminal-based mini projects**, and **API/Numpy-driven utilities** that I’ve built while learning **core and advanced Python**.
It includes both logic-building exercises and real-world applications — gradually preparing me for **AI/ML development**.

## Basic Practice Problems
<small>Strengthen Python fundamentals and core topics</small>

[Simple Calculator](./calculator.py)<br>
[Guess The Number game](./guessTheNumber.py)<br>
[Guess The Word game](./GuessTheWord.py)<br>
[Password Checker](./passwordChecker.py)<br>
[Simple Quiz](./Quiz.py)


## File Management Projects (CLI)
<small>Practice of file handing (`.csv`, `.txt`,`.json`)</small>

[Contact Book](./Contact%20Book/)<br>
[Library Management System](./LMS/)<br>
[Password Management System](./Password%20Manager/)<br>
[Personal Expense Tracker](./Personal%20Expense%20Tracker/)<br>
[Product Billing System](./Product%20Billing%20System/)<br>
[Student Management System](./Student%20Record%20Management/)<br>
[To Do List](./To-Do/)<br>

This is part of my Python learning journey toward AI/ML.
